LEO Satellite Diversity

Non-Terrestrial Networks are expected to form one of the backbones of the emerging 6G Networks. LEO satellites are an enabling technology, allowing for relatively low latency Non-Terrestrial Access to 5G, B5G and, 6G in the future. 
LEO Satellites, i.e. Low Earth Orbit satellites are spaceborne vehicles that reside in altitudes of 600 km from Earth's surface. They differ from the traditional GEO satellite by moving at high speeds to maintain their altitudes. 
A typical LEO satellite moves at a speed of approx. 7.5 km/s. The satellite's mobility introduces high Doppler Shifts and limited visibility, demanding multiple LEO satellites to supply continuous data service. A set of LEO satellites that
provide service to users is called a constellation. This research aspires to combine the traditional spatial diversity schemes with LEO constellations to provide highly reliable and robust NTN connections to ground terminals.
